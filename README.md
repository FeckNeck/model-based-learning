# poisson-mixture-model

This project was carried out during my second year of a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in MALIA.
The objective was to implement an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, an iterative procedure for estimating parameters in statistical models when latent variables are involved. This package focuses on the application of the EM algorithm to fit a multivariate Poisson distribution to given data.

# Installation
